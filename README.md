CloudKit, Apple’s remote data storage service, provides a possibility to store app data using users’ iCloud accounts as a back-end storage service.

Here is the same demo on [Objective-C](https://github.com/Yalantis/CloudKit-Demo.Objective-C).

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- XCode 8
- Swift 3

## How To Get Started

- Set up Cloud/CloudKit at iOS Developer Portal.
- Insert a bundle identifier and choose a corresponding Team.
- Select Capabilities tab in the target editor, and then switch ON the iCloud.

## Usage

### Retrieve existing records

```swift
let predicate = NSPredicate(value: true)
let query = CKQuery(recordType: recordType, predicate: predicate)
CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase.perform(query, inZoneWith: nil) { records, error in

}
```

### Create a new record

```swift
let record = CKRecord(recordType: "RecordType")
record.setValue("Some data", forKey: "key")
CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase.save(record) { savedRecord, error in

}
```

### Update the record

```swift
let recordId = CKRecordID(recordName: "RecordType")
CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase.fetch(withRecordID: recordId) { updatedRecord, error in  
    if error != nil {
        return
    }

    updatedRecord.setObject("Some data", forKey: "key")
    CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase.save(updatedRecord) { savedRecord, error in

    }
}
```

### Remove the record

```swift
let recordId = CKRecordID(recordName: recordId)
CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase.delete(withRecordID: recordId) { deletedRecordId, error in

}
```
